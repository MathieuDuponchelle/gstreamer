Tracing
=======

This subsystem will provide a mechanism to get structured tracing info from
GStreamer applications. This can be used for post-run analysis as well as for
live introspection.

Use cases
---------
* I'd like to get statistics from a running application.

* I'd like to to understand which parts of my pipeline use how many resources.

* I'd like to know which parts of the pipeline use how much memory.

* I'd like to know about ref-counts of parts in the pipeline to find ref-count
  issues.

Non use-cases
-------------
* Some element in the pipeline does not play along the rules, find out which
  one. This could be done with generic tests.

Design
------

The system brings the following new items:
core hooks: probes in the core api, that will expose internal state when tracing
  is in use
tracers: plugin features that can process data from the hooks and emit a log
tracing front-ends: applications that consume logs from tracers

Like the logging, the tracer hooks can be compiled out and if not use a local
condition to check if active.

Certain GStreamer core function (such as gst_pad_push or gst_element_add_pad)
will call into the tracer subsystem to dispatch into active tracing modules.
Developers will be able to select a list of plugins by setting an environment
variable, such as GST_TRACE="meminfo,dbus". One can also pass parameters to
plugins:  GST_TRACE="log(events,buffers);stats(all)".
When then plugins are loaded, we'll add them to certain hooks according to which
they are interested in.

Right now tracing info is logged as GstStructures to the TRACE level. 
Idea: Another env var GST_TRACE_CHANNEL could be used to send the tracing to a
file or a socket. See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=733188 for
discussion on these environment variables.

Hook api
--------
We'll wrap interesting api calls with two macros, e.g. gst_pad_push():

GstFlowReturn
gst_pad_push (GstPad * pad, GstBuffer * buffer)
{
  GstFlowReturn res;

  g_return_val_if_fail (GST_IS_PAD (pad), GST_FLOW_ERROR);
  g_return_val_if_fail (GST_PAD_IS_SRC (pad), GST_FLOW_ERROR);
  g_return_val_if_fail (GST_IS_BUFFER (buffer), GST_FLOW_ERROR);

  GST_TRACER_PAD_PUSH_PRE (pad, buffer);
  res = gst_pad_push_data (pad,
      GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BUFFER | GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PUSH, buffer);
  GST_TRACER_PAD_PUSH_POST (pad, res);
  return res;
}

TODO(ensonic): gcc has some magic for wrapping functions

TODO(ensonic): we should eval if we can use something like jump_label in the kernel

TODO(ensonic): liblttng-ust provides such a mechanism for user-space
- but this is mostly about logging traces
- it is linux specific :/

In addition to api hooks we should also provide timer hooks. Interval timers are
useful to get e.g. resource usage snapshots. Also absolute timers might make
sense. All this could be implemented with a clock thread.

Hooks (* already implemented)
-----
- gst_bin_add
- gst_bin_remove
- gst_element_add_pad
* gst_element_post_message
* gst_element_query
- gst_element_remove_pad
- gst_pad_link
* gst_pad_pull_range
* gst_pad_push
* gst_pad_push_list
* gst_pad_push_event
- gst_pad_unlink

Plugin api
----------

TracerPlugins are plugin features. They have a simple api:

instance creation
Plugins can attach handlers to one or more hooks. They use a HookMask to tell
which events they are interested in. The params are the extra detail from the
environment var.

void invoke(GstTracerHookId id, GstStructure *s);
Hooks marshal the parameters given to a trace hook into varargs and also
add some extra into such as a timestamp. Hooks will be called from misc threads.
The trace plugins should only consume (=read) the provided data.
Most trace plugins will log data to a trace channel.

instance destruction
Plugins can output results and release data. This would ideally be done at the
end of the applications, but gst_deinit() is not mandatory. gst_tracelib was
using a gcc_destructor. Ideally tracer modules log data as they have it and
leave aggregation to a tool that processed the log.

tracer event classes (not implemented yet)
--------------------
tracers will describe the data the log here (gst_tracer_class_add_event_class).
Most tracers will log some kind of 'events' : a data transfer, an event,
a message, a query or a measurement.

GstTraceEventClass { // meta data for events, can be printed from gst-inspect
  gchar *name;         // something that front ends can use as a label for a graph
                       // should ideally contain a unit
  gchar *description;  // something that front ends can use as a tooltip
  
  GstTraceEventScope scope; // a way to associate the event
  // enum(per process, thread, element, pad, ...)

  Gst??? type; // some kind of hierarchical event type? or make name a 'path'
  // event.eos, event.seek.flushing, measurement.cpu.load, ...
  
  GstTraceEventClassFlags flags;  // cummulative, ...
}

GstTraceEvent {
  GstClockTime ts; // when did it happen
  gpointer owner;  // GThread, GObject, ...
  // payloads:
  // - array of unions
  // - GstStructure
  //   - we can just serialize this for logging and easily deserialize it in
  //     the front-ends using gst_structure_{from,to}_string()
  //   - we would have 'ts' and 'owner' in the structure
  //   - the structure 'name-id' can be used to lookup the GstTraceEventClass
  // - GVariant ?
}

instead of "gpointer owner", we could send a trace-events that register new
owners with an id (atomic int) and unregister them at the end of their
live-time. Then we can reference the owner as "guint owner".

We could also consider to add each value as a READABLE gobject property. The
property has name/description. We could use qdata for scope and flags (or have
some new property flags).
We would also need a new "notify" signal, so that value-change notifications 
would include a time-stamp. This way the tracers would not needs to be aware of
the logging. The core tracer would register the notify handlers and emit the
log.
Or we just add a gst_tracer_class_install_event() and that mimics the 
g_object_class_install_property().

The log would have a bunch of streams. A stream has a reference to the 
GstTraceEventClass.

Frontends can:
- do an events over time histogram
- plot curves of values over time or deltas
- show gauges
- collect statistics (min, max, avg, ...)

Plugins ideas
=============

We can have some under gstreamer/plugins/tracers/

latency
-------
- register to buffer and event flow
- send custom event on buffer flow at source elements
- catch events on event transfer at sink elements

meminfo (not yet implemented)
-------
- register to an interval-timer hook.
- call mallinfo() and log memory usage

rusage
------
- register to an interval-timer hook.
- call getrusage() and log resource usage

dbus (not yet implemented)
----
- provide a dbus iface to announce applications that are traced
- tracing UIs can use the dbus iface to find the channels where logging and
  tracing is getting logged to
- one would start the tracing UI first and when the application is started with
  tracing activated, the dbus plugin will announce the new application,
  upon which the tracing UI can start reading from the log channels, this avoid
  missing some data

topology (not yet implemented)
--------
- register to pipeline topology hooks
- tracing UIs can show a live pipeline graph

stats
-----
- register to buffer, event, message and query flow
- tracing apps can do e.g. statistics

User interfaces
===============

gst-debug-viewer
----------------
gst-debug-viewer could be given the trace log in addition to the debug log (or a
combined log). Alternatively it would show a dialog that shows all local apps
(if the dbus plugin is loaded) and read the log streams from the sockets/files
that are configured for the app.

gst-tracer
----------
Counterpart of gst-tracelib-ui.

gst-stats
---------
A terminal app that shows summary/running stats like the summary gst-tracelib
shows at the end of a run. Currently only shows an aggregated status.

live-graphers
-------------
Maybe we can even feed the log into existing live graphers, with a little driver
* https://github.com/dkogan/feedgnuplot


Problems / Open items
=====================
- should tracers log into the debug.log or into a separate log?
  - in the log we need a bit of protocol:
    - log the GST_TRACE var, so that front-ends can understand what tracers 
      where active and what parameters where passed.
  - separate log
    - use a binary format?
    - worse performance (we're writing two logs at the same time)
    - need to be careful when people to GST_DEBUG_CHANNEL=stderr and
      GST_TRACE_CHANNEL=stderr (use a shared channel, but what about the
      formats?)
  - debug log
    - the tracer subsystem would need to log the GST_TRACE at a level that is
      active
    - should the tracer call gst_debug_category_set_threshold() to ensure things
      work, even though the levels don't make a lot of sense here
  - make logging a tracer (a hook in gst_debug_log_valist, move
    gst_debug_log_default() to the tracer module)
    - log all debug log to the tracer log, some of the current logging
      statements can be replaced by generic logging as shown in the log-tracer
    - add tools/gst-debug to extract a human readable debug log from the trace
      log

- when hooking into a timer, should we just have some predefined intervals?
  - can we add a tracer module that registers the timer hook? then we could do
      GST_TRACER="timer(10ms);rusage"
    right now the tracer hooks are defined as an enum though.
- when connecting to a running app, we can't easily get the 'current' state if
  logging is using a socket, as past events are not explicitly stored, we could
  determine the current topology and emit events with GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE as ts
  to indicate that the events are synthetic.
